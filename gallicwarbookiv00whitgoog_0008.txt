PREFACE.

F 0R some long time past it has been widely felt
that a reduction in the cost ol Classical Works
used in schools generally, and more especially in
those intended sor boys ol the middle classes, is at
once desirable and not difficult of accomplishment.

For the most part only portions of authors are read
in the earlier stages of education‚ and a pupil is
Ι taken from one work to another in each successive

⁹ hals-year or term 3 so that a book needlessly large
and proportionably expensive is laid aside after a
short and but partial use.

ln order, therefore, to meet what is certainly a
want, Portions of the Classical Writers usually
read in Schools are now being issued under the
title os Garunna Senoon Tnxrs; while, at the
request of various Masters, it has been determined
to add to the series some portions os the Greek
Testament.

Each ΤΕΧΤ is provided with aVocABULnRv of the
words occurring in it. In every instance-with the ’
exception ol Eutropius and AEsop-the origin ot a
word, when known, is stated at the commentemur*
ol the article treating oi it,il connecteownn mm
