’ ἰν PREFACE.

Latin, or Greek, word; at the end of it, if derived
from any other source. F urther still, the primary

or etymological meaning is always given, within
invented commas, in Roman type, and so much
also ol each word's history as is needful to bring
⁴ down its chain of meanings to the especial force, or
sorece, attaching to it in the particular “Text''
ln the Vocabularies, however, to Eutropius and
AEsop-which are essentially books for beginners
-the origin is given of those words alone which
are formed from other Latin or Greek words, re·
spectively.

Moreover‚ as an acquaintance with the principles
- of GRAMMAR, as well as with Evvwonocv‚ is
necessary to the understanding of a language, such
points ol construction as seem to require elucida-
tion are concisely explained under the proper
articles or a reference is simply made to that rule
iu the Public Schools Latin Prirner, or in Parrys
Elementary Greek Grammur, which meets the
particular difficulty. lt occasionally happens, how·
ever, that more information is needed than can be
gathered from the above-named works. When
such is the case, whatever is requisito is supplied,
in substance, from Jelfs Greek Grummar, Wz'nests
GrammarofNew T estament Greek, or the Latin
Grammars of Zumpt and Madvig.
